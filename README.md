# Real Latvian CMS Utils: ElasticSearch library

Vairogs Utils are a set of different helper libraries created for Symfony 4 framework. 
In order to implement any of additional libraries, it is needed to require each of them seperately.
Core repository is the base and is required by other libraries in order to configure them.

If you have found any bug or would like an extra feature to any of existing libraries, please file an issue in vairogs-core repository.
